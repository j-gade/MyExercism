Iteration 2:
I learned a lot of things from other user implementations and I
adjusted/rewrote this iteration using those ideas.

1. I used "using" typedefs for my own type aliases, assuring that they could be
	changed in future iterations. I saw this in a couple of community
	submissions, also typedefs.
2. I learned more about std::maps and std::vectors. Although I didn't use the fact that a
	find method on a std::map would return a pointer to a std::pair of the key::value of the map, which
	was confusing in some submissions, I learned to check for other conditions.
	There doesn't seem to be a lot of direct tutorials on this.
3. I did learn that a std::map iterator returned by find is a pointer to a std::pair of <key, value>.
	The documentation isn't very clear on that. Or that a map holds std::pair values.
4. I started learning the value/use-cases of anonymous namespaces. I will need
	to practice more.
